      </center>
      <p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 20px;">A website can be divided into pieces a lot of different ways. You can divide up the process of development into stages, or you can look at the individual parts. But a website is not like a car. The pieces don’t screw together or came apart in the same way. What makes a website work is the interaction between components that are separated in space and, possibly, time.</p>

               <h2>The Page Layout</h2>
               <p>This is the way things appear on the page. Is the navigation menu on the top or along the side? Are there images above the text area? Tables? Good layout is as important as any other element of design. Bad layout makes a website look crowded and slapdash. Good layout allows the eye to find what it seeks easily.</p>

               <h2>Front End Elements</h2>
               <p>People often describe the website as having a front end and back end. In this analogy, front end is what you see, back end is what you don’t.</p>

               <p>Few websites exist just to be looked at. The internet began as a method of sharing information. As it evolved into the World Wide Web, it became rich in all kind of media.</p>
